# Ignite-Engine
Game engine powered by the Pygame library.

It's meant to be a simple and qualified tool for developing games in Python, using "Pygame" that is a "Python extension library
that wraps the SDL library and its helpers."

# Creator Message
This game engine was not meant for distribution purposes, it is just a personal project, so, if you find this repo'
searching for a high level game engine, you should seek somewhere else.

In other hand, if you have come just for curiosity, please feel free to contribute and share your opinion about my work.

# Dependencies
As said in the description; "Ignite" uses the Pygame library to work, that's why requires the next dependencies (for the moment):

- Python3
- Pygame Library

# Development Road-Map
This is the list of goals/features that i plan to add to "Ignite" <<like sticks into the flame!>>:

- Complete physics system
- Complete Sprite system
- Complete UI system
- Complete Audio system
